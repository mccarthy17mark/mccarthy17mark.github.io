# My name is Mark McCarthy #
## I am a data scientist and software developer based in Toronto ##

I love to make interesting models out of complex datasets; to find meaning from chaos. I'm a problem-solver at heart with a passion for story-telling.

I've been an engineer, a physicist, a software developer, and a data scientist. There's a lot in my toolbelt that I'm itching to use!

Shall we make something cool together?

This site is meant to serve as both a portfolio and a blog. Send me an email at mccarthy17mark[at]gmail.com to contact me!
