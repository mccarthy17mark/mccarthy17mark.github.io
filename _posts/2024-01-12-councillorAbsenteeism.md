I find myself in a position where my previous work is proprietary to my former employers, and I don't have much of a publicly available portfolio. To fix this, I wanted to find a sizeable public dataset then perform a non-trivial analysis, and to have **fun** doing it! In this project I used attendance data from the city councils of Toronto to study councillor absenteeism, and you can read about this below. I later wrote a clustering algorithm to group councillors based their voting records and you can see the analysis in [another notebook](https://github.com/markomemos/councillors/blob/master/councillor_clustering.ipynb).

Many municipalities have open source data available on a very wide number of topics. For example, in Toronto you can find data on everything from all public city-provided wifi, to red-light camera locations, to restaurant food inspection results. Here are the data for [Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/), and specifically the data used in this analysis is [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/members-of-toronto-city-council-meeting-attendance/).
