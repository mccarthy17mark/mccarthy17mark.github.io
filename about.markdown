# My name is Mark McCarthy #
## I am a data scientist based in Toronto ##

I love to make interesting models out of complex datasets; to find meaning from chaos.

I've been an engineer, a physicist, and a software developer. I've gathered many tools for solving complex problems.

Shall we make something cool together?
