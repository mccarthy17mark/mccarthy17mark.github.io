# My name is Mark McCarthy #
## I am a data scientist based in Toronto ##

I love to make interesting models out of complex datasets; to find meaning from chaos.

I've been an engineer, a physicist, and a software developer. I've gathered many tools for solving complex problems.

Shall we make something cool together?

This site is meant to serve as both a portfolio and a blog. Send me an email to contact me!

ignore the stuff below... it will be handled later but I don't want to lose these links quite yet.
